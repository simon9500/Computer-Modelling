# Computer Modelling
Work done in Python for the course Computer Modelling in 3rd year of my degree.

To run type:

`python simulationLJ.py youroutputfile.dat particle.input`

in the terminal.

The output file will contain the particles positions over the full duration of the simulation and can be visualised using VMD (see http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).  I only ran this program on University computers with VMD pre-installed.
